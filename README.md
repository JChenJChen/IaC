# IaC


Infrastructure-as-Code is the method of deploying and managing infrastructure declaratively with metadata, and ideally automatically applied with CI/CD (continuous integration/deployment) pipeline.


This repo focuses on:

- cloud infra providers:
  - GCP
  - AWS
- IaC tools:
  - Terraform -- for both providers
  - CloudFormation -- only for AWS
